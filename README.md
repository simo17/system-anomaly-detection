System Log Anomaly Detection Project

By the limitation of GitHub, the whole HDFS dataset cannot be upload due to its size. Instead, we take the first 200,000 lines of
log messages to form a shorten version of the HDFS dataset as a sample. We provide two demos in the ./demo folder. They merely
demonstrates how the code works. Noted that the experiments described in the final paper was conducted on the whole dataset.
